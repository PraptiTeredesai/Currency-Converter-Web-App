Here's a `README.md` file that explains the usage and functionality of your currency converter app:
Currency Converter Web App

This is a simple currency converter web application that allows users to convert currencies using real-time exchange rates. It fetches data from the ExchangeRate-API and dynamically updates the conversion result.
 Features
- Convert between any two currencies.
- Automatically selects default currencies (USD to INR).
- Fetches real-time exchange rates using ExchangeRate-API.
- Displays the corresponding flags for selected currencies.
- Automatically updates the conversion upon changing the selected currency or amount.

How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have an active internet connection (required to fetch exchange rates).
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to load the app.
4. The app will display the conversion from USD to INR by default.
5. You can select different currencies from the dropdown menus and input the amount to convert.
6. Click the "Convert" button to display the conversion result.

Setup Instructions

-Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
- Internet connection to fetch the latest exchange rates.

-Running the App
1. Clone or download this project to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/currency-converter.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and open `index.html` in your browser.

-API Key
This app uses the [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) to get real-time currency exchange rates. You will need an API key to use this service.

- Replace the API key in the JavaScript code (`app.js`) with your own:
  ```javascript
  const BASE_URL = "https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/YOUR_API_KEY/latest/";
  ```

-File Structure

- **index.html**: Contains the main structure and UI of the currency converter.
- **style.css**: Styles for the app's layout and design.
- **app.js**: Core logic for fetching exchange rates, handling currency selection, and updating the conversion result.

-Code Explanation

-Main Logic
The JavaScript file (`app.js`) handles the following functionalities:

- **Currency Selection**: It populates the dropdown menus with available currencies using `countryList`. The `USD` and `INR` currencies are selected by default.
  
- **Flag Update**: When the user selects a currency, the flag associated with that country is updated using the `updateFlag` function, which fetches the flag image from the Flags API.

- **Exchange Rate Calculation**: The `updateExchangeRate` function calculates the conversion rate based on the selected currencies and amount. It fetches real-time exchange rates from the ExchangeRate-API and displays the result.

-Event Listeners
- **Form Submission**: The app listens for the "Convert" button click, preventing the default form behavior and updating the exchange rate instead.
  
- **Dropdown Change**: When the user changes a currency from the dropdown, the associated flag is updated.

-External Resources
- **[ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)**: For fetching real-time currency exchange rates.
- **[FlagsAPI](https://flagsapi.com/)**: For fetching country flags based on the selected currency code.
